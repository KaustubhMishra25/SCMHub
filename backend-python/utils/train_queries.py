----- SAMPLE_QUESTIONS -----


**Q1:** How can we determine the most cost-effective order quantity for a product with an annual demand of x units, an ordering cost of  y per order, and a holding cost of 
z per unit per year?

**A:** To optimize inventory levels, we can apply the EOQ model, considering the monthly demand. The EOQ formula remains the same:

EOQ = √2DS/√H

Where:

D = Monthly demand (units)
S = Ordering cost per order ($/order)
H = Holding cost per unit per month ($/unit/month)

Substituting the given values into the formula:

EOQ= √2xy/√z

Optimal Solution: Ordering approximately √2zy/√z units per order would minimize total inventory costs, considering the monthly demand and associated ordering and holding costs.



**Q:** How can we optimize inventory levels for a product with a monthly demand of x units, an ordering cost of y per order, and a holding cost of z per unit per month?

**A:** The EPQ model is suitable for situations where continuous production is possible and inventory is produced in batches rather than being ordered from suppliers. It aims to minimize total inventory costs by determining the optimal production quantity.

Calculation:

The formula for calculating the Economic Production Quantity (EPQ) is:

EPQ= √2DS/√ H

Where:

D = Monthly demand (units)
S = Setup or ordering cost per production run ($/order)
H = Holding cost per unit per month ($/unit/month)

Substituting the given values into the formula:

EPQ= √2xy/√z

Therefore, the calculated EPQ is approximately √2xy/√z units.

**Q:** How can we optimize inventory levels for a product with a quarterly demand of 
x units, an ordering cost of y per order, and a holding cost of z per unit per quarter?

**A:** To determine the most cost-effective order quantity, we can utilize the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model. The EOQ formula is:

EOQ = √2DS/√H
 
Where:

D = Annual demand (units)
S = Ordering cost per order ($/order)
H = Holding cost per unit per year ($/unit/year)

Substituting the given values into the formula:

EOQ= √2xy/√z

Optimal Solution: Ordering approximately √2xy/√z units per order would minimize total inventory costs, balancing ordering costs with holding costs, while ensuring sufficient inventory to meet customer demand.

**Q:** How can we determine the optimal reorder point for a product with a variable demand rate (D) and lead time (L), considering a desired service level (SL) and variability in demand (x) and lead time (y)?

**A**

Optimal Solution:
The optimal reorder point (ROP) can be calculated using the following formula, considering safety stock to buffer against demand and lead time variability:

ROP =(D*L) + (Z * √ (x^2 * L) + (D* y^2) )

Where:

D = Variable demand rate (units/time)
L = Lead time (time)
SL = Desired service level (expressed as a probability)
x = Standard deviation of demand during lead time (units)
y= Standard deviation of lead time (time)
Z = Z-score corresponding to the desired service level (e.g., for a 95% service level, Z=1.645)

Substituting the values:

ROP =(D*L) + (Z * √ (x^2 * L) + (D* y^2) )

Therefore, the calculated reorder point is approximately (D*L) + (Z * √ (x^2 * L) + (D* y^2) )  units.

**Q:**Retailer GHI stocks electronic gadgets with a service level (SL) target of x%. The demand variability(w) is estimated at y units per week, and the lead time variability v is estimated at z days. What is the optimal inventory level for a product with uncertain demand and lead times to meet service level requirements?

**A:**
Calculate the reorder point (ROP) using the service level optimization model:

ROP=μ+Z×σ
Where:

μ = Mean demand during lead time
Z = Z-score corresponding to the desired service level
σ = Standard deviation of demand during lead time

Given:

SL: Service level target
w: Demand variability (units per week)
v: Lead time variability (days)

We need to first calculate μ and σ based on the provided information. Then, we'll use the Z-score corresponding to the desired service level (SL) to determine ROP, which represents the optimal inventory level.

Calculation:

Calculate 

μ=w×v

Calculate 

σ=√ w×v
​
Determine the Z-score corresponding to the desired service level (SL).

Calculate 

ROP=μ+Z×σ


**Q:** A manufacturing company, ABC Corp, sources raw materials from multiple suppliers located across the country. Each supplier offers different prices for the same raw material, and transportation costs vary based on distance. ABC Corp needs to determine the optimal allocation of orders to suppliers to minimize transportation costs while meeting demand requirements. The transportation costs per unit distance and demand requirements are as follows:

Supplier 1: Distance = x miles, Transportation Cost = w per unit, Demand = y units
Supplier 2: Distance = y miles, Transportation Cost = z per unit, Demand = x units
Supplier 3: Distance = z miles, Transportation Cost = w per unit, Demand = z units

ABC Corp needs to allocate orders to suppliers to minimize transportation costs while ensuring that the total demand of D units is met.

**A:** To find the optimal allocation of orders to suppliers, ABC Corp can use a linear programming model. Here's the formulation:


Let p,q,r represent the number of units ordered from suppliers 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost, given by:

Minimize wp + zq +qr 

Subject to the following constraints:

Demand constraint:

p+q+r =D

Non-negativity constraint:
 
p>=0, q>= 0, r>=0
​
Solving this linear programming model will provide the optimal allocation of orders to suppliers, minimizing transportation costs while meeting demand requirements.

Optimal Solution:

Solving the linear programming model, we find the optimal allocation of orders:

p = y units from Supplier 1
q = x units from Supplier 2
r = z units from Supplier 3

Total transportation cost =  w⋅y+z⋅x+w⋅z

So, the optimal allocation of orders minimizes the transportation cost while meeting the demand requirements.
